# advent-of-code

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems with varying languages.


## TODO

- Setup shared lib that can be used cross-yearly using [cargo-workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html)
- Setup CI/CD that runs benchmarks for changed directories/ have some auto-updating benchmarking results in each years' README.md
